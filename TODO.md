        - client.telnet.GMCPSupports.push('IED 1');
        - Add #win support if added
        - The old web client had a simple upload for uploading a file to current working directory, seems ot have broken at some point
    - Add mail composer like jiMUD using advanced editor dialog as a base as exact same code but adds to/cc/subject fields and instead of sending directly it executes a set of commands to open mail and send contents
- Profile manager:
    - Add undo system
    - Add search system
    - Add advanced value editor using ace or maybe monaco editor, granted this is more complex with how the interface is designed, would require recreating the editor every time one of the pages loaded and could be slow, may be best to try code mirror as it is newer and more modern and easier to use then monaco i think
        - Docs: - `Enable profile manager code editor` disable or enable the code editor for the profile manager
    - Add max/min value button to expand value box to full side panel or maybe open a model dialog for more rooms
    - Add lazy loading support instead of building entire menu at once
- recode advanced editor to not use jquery when possible
- Add paste special? may not be possible as cant control paste
- Mapper
    - Recode map backend into a worker to get/set rooms etc... granted localforage does not work in workers so adds extra layer of complexity
    - Add true mapper window
- run firefox/chrome performance tools to optimize code/loading
- Add advanced setting view for complex editing
- Maybe allow custom protocols in the ansi parser to create links
